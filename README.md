  # Audio Processing Projects Repository

## Author
Kris Cooper

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of Python projects focused on audio processing and synthesis, showcasing various techniques for sound generation, manipulation, and enhancement.

## Contents
1. **PopGen**:
   - Generates pseudo-melodies using chord and bass notes.
   - Features waveform options, custom/random chord progressions, and dynamic time signatures.
   - Enhancements: Added waveform variety, chord-loop customization, and time signature support.

2. **Clipped Audio System**:
   - Demonstrates WAV file generation and playback.
   - Creates and plays pure and clipped sine waves with a focus on demonstrating distortion effects.
   - Highlights: Real-time playback, clipping visualization, and foundational audio manipulation.

3. **Tone Control Audio Processing**:
   - Implements a tone control system to adjust low, mid, and high frequency bands.
   - Features dynamic range compression, normalization, and smoothing to ensure balanced audio quality.
   - Techniques: FFT-based adjustments, overlap-add processing, and real-time audio smoothing.

## Usage
Each project includes its own `README.md` with detailed installation steps, features, and usage examples.
