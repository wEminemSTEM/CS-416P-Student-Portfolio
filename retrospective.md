# Retrospective: Audio Processing Projects

## Author
Kris Cooper

## Overview
This retrospective summarizes the key achievements and challenges from audio processing projects completed during Fall 2024 in CS-416P at PSU.

## Highlights
1. **PopGen**:
   - Developed a melody generator with customizable waveforms, chord progressions, and time signatures.
   - Learned to combine music theory with algorithmic programming.

2. **Clipped Audio System**:
   - Created and demonstrated sine wave clipping and real-time playback.
   - Gained insight into distortion effects and audio signal handling.

3. **Tone Control Audio Processing**:
   - Implemented a tone control system with frequency band adjustments and compression.
   - Improved skills in dynamic processing and FFT-based analysis.

## Reflections
These projects enhanced my programming expertise and understanding of audio processing techniques. Future efforts will focus on optimizing real-time performance and exploring more advanced sound synthesis methods.
